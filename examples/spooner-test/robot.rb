Hello everyone, I am #{name} (#{id})!
* My project can be found at http://github.com/diminish7/rave
* I like to comment on what people are doing (submitting and deleting blips).
* I will say hello and goodbye as people arrive or leave the wave.
* Submit a blip containing only "#{DELETE_COMMAND}" and I'll delete it for you.
* Submit a blip containing "#{INVITE_COMMAND} fish@frog.com" to invite that user/robot into the wavelet.
